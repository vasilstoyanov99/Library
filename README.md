# Library
A simple ASP.NET Core MVC Web App which I created to exercise what I've learned from the ASP.NET Core course at SoftUni.

## :information_source: How It Works

**Guests**
- Have access to home page for guests, all books page and details page. Can log in or register.

**Users**
- Have access to all books page and details page. Can add new books and edit or delete books only from my library page.

**Admin**
- Have access to all books page and details page. Can add new books and edit or delete any of all the books in the DB.

**When you run the project for the first time sample data will be seeded as well as these test accounts:**

- User 1 -> email: **user1@library.bg** / password: **123456**
- User 2 -> email: **user2@library.bg** / password: **123456**
- Admin -> email: **admin@library.bg** / password: **123456**
